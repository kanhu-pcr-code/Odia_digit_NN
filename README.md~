# Odia_digit_NN
This is a project to implement Neural Network approach to recognise hand written odia digits.





# Generating Training set

## Hand written digits
1. Odia digits 0-9 were written on a lined paper and photo graphed using Android Phone Camera.
2. Images were cropped mauly using GIMP on ubuntu OS.

## Cropping images with GIMP and ImageMagic 
 Each stripp is cropped using Imagemagic Commands. each strip containig 5-6 digits

> cuts an image into 5 sections, 1 per row, with 20 pixels of horizontal padding, 1 pixels of vertical padding excluded from each section
convert 17.png -crop 1x5-20-1@ +repage +adjoin tile-%d.jpg
About 10 training sets per digit created


## Converting images into grey scale
convert  9_1.jpg  -colorspace Gray   grey/9_1.jpg


# OCTAVE processing
img = imread('grey/9_1.jpg')
imshow(img)
size(img)
ans =

   251   155

save -binary odia_9 img
